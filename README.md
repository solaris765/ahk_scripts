Right now. One script that handles opening/focusing windows terminal and spotify with `ctrl+alt+t` and `ctrl+alt+m` respectively.

## Setup
Install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
And you can paste a shortcut to the script into your startup folder if you want it to run on startup.
open the run dialog (Win+R) and type `shell:startup` to navigate to your personal startup directory.
